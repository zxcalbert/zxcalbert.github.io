This is my personal website in which I made several pages based on my readings and hobbies.

I used 10 different HTML tags:
1.<html>
2.<head>
3.<meta>
4.<title>
5.<link>
6.<body>
7.<nav>
8.<div>
9.<a>
10.<button>

I used 5 different CSS properties:
1.font-family
2.padding-top
3.background-color
4.color
5.margin-bottom

I use Javascript to add dynamic functionality to the footer, specially to display the current time.

Bootstrap helps me add pre-styled components such as navigation bar, jumbotron into the website to maintaining the visual consistency.
